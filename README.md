# PhD_Thesis_Brief Synopsis of Research:
The study area encompasses the Delhi Supergroup granulites in the border regions of Gujarat and Rajasthan, India. Structural mapping of a corridor passing through the low-grade to high-grade terranes 
and the intervening shear zone has been conducted to comprehend the folding patterns, variations in metamorphic grade on both sides, and the influence of shearing on the style of folding. 
Shear kinematics (including thrusting, strike-slip, or normal slip) at the contact zone have been determined to ascertain the manner in which the granulites were emplaced into the upper crustal rocks.
